# Visualization of BFS algorithm
The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is used
to search a tree or graph data structure for a node
that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the treeâ€™s 
root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current 
depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth 
level. Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems
in graph theory.

## Explanation
This application will help you visualize how the BFS algorithm traverses 
through a 10x10 grid-like graph.

### Button explenation
* Add wall: adds a wall on the cell you click or drag upon several
* Delete wall: deletes(reset to default) any cell you click or drag upon
* Add Start: adds a starting point for the BFS Algorithm to start
* BFS: starts the visualization
* Show Edges: shows the default edges made when the grid is created
* Reset: resets the grid to default
* Randomize: makes random walls on the grid (click again to re-randomize)

## How to run
* Open your java IDE of choice
* Run Main.java (bfsAlgo/src/main/java/com/example/bfsalgo)
